/**
 * workflow-tracker.cjs — PostToolUse hook for Forge workflow state tracking.
 *
 * Fires after every tool call. Silently exits for non-Forge tools.
 * For Forge MCP tools, updates the session state file so that other hooks
 * (stop-observer, prompt-router) know whether a workflow is active.
 *
 * Handles three transitions:
 *   1. Workflow start: forge__start_workflow succeeds
 *      → writes { active_workflow: true }
 *   2. Observer outcome: forge__update_state with observation_outcome event
 *      → writes { status } so stop-observer checkpoint logic can fire
 *   3. Workflow completion: forge__update_state returns a completed workflow
 *      → writes { active_workflow: false, observer_blocked: true }
 *
 * This replaces the previous approach of asking Claude to write the state
 * file via SKILL.md instructions — Claude consistently forgot because the
 * MCP response's large instruction block captured its attention.
 *
 * @see plugin/hooks/session-state.cjs for state management
 * @see plugin/hooks/stop-observer.cjs for the Stop hook that reads this state
 * @see plugin/skills/forge-autopilot/SKILL.md for the routing skill

 * Extract the human-readable text from a PostToolUse `tool_response`.
 *
 * MCP tool responses arrive as a structured payload — not a string —
 * in one of two shapes depending on the client:
 *   - Wrapped envelope: `{ content: [{ type: "text", text: "…" }] }`
 *   - Bare content array: `[{ type: "text", text: "…" }]` (Claude Code)
 *
 * `JSON.stringify`-ing either shape escapes every real newline into a
 * literal `\n` sequence, which breaks any regex that relies on `[^\n]`
 * line boundaries or matches quoted/comma'd content. This helper pulls
 * the actual text payload so the extractors below operate on the
 * response as the orchestrator rendered it.
 *
 * Unlike must-display.cjs, this does NOT follow a bare file path to a reply
 * the host saved to disk. must-display only turns a file into a one-line
 * breadcrumb; here the text becomes authorization state (allowlist, write
 * lock, CHECKPOINT pin), and a path is honoured wherever it points — nothing
 * confines it to the host's own tool-results directory, whose location and
 * hook-payload shape are not verified. A replaced reply is instead handled by
 * the server keeping replies under REPLY_BUDGET_BYTES and by the
 * get_workflow_state re-sync below.

 * The header is the run of status, marker and metadata lines at the top of the

 * line may separate the status line from the marker and the marker from its
 * metadata, but once the metadata run has started the next blank line ends the
 * header — otherwise the body's first line joins it whenever it looks like
 * metadata. The first line of any other kind starts the body. It is read after
 * any must-display block the reply leads with: none does today, but that block
 * is copy for the user and can quote a header too.
 *
 * One exception to "the first other line starts the body": some older
 * servers rendered an advance's findings (caption,
 * `## Findings`, relay line, display block, `---`) between its status line and
 * its marker. Stopping there lost the marker, and with it the next step's tool
 * permissions and write lock. When only a status line has been read and the
 * run is not complete, that one region is stepped over and the header read on
 * — never adopted into it, and only when exactly one marker follows before the
 * step envelope (findingsRegionEnd).
 *
 * Behind Codex's functions.exec wrapper the script's own output surrounds the
 * reply, so a log line it printed first can be marker-shaped. There the first
 * STRUCTURED header wins — a marker with the status line or metadata run that
 * belongs to it — and a lone marker-shaped line only stands when nothing
 * structured follows it. A first candidate carrying a status line is the

 * no marker) is never traded for something its body quotes.
 *
 * When the reply has not opened at all — nothing header-shaped led it, because
 * the script printed plain output first — the scan is looking for where the
 * reply BEGINS, so a status line there is its own and ends the search too. A
 * completion carries no marker, so demanding one skipped it and left a finished
 * run locally active and pinned, or handed its step and allowlist to whatever
 * its body quoted. Once a marker has opened a candidate, a later status line is
 * the script's trailing output and stays ineligible.
 *
 * That leaves shapes the wrapper cannot resolve, both turning on a marker with
 * NO metadata — Codex gives no reply boundary to tell a logged echo from the
 * real reply. Its body quoting a structured header reads as an echo followed by
 * that reply; and when plain output preceded it, so the reply never opened, a
 * status line in the script's TRAILING output is still eligible and would be
 * read as a completion. Both need the server to emit a metadata-less marker,
 * and it does not: every CHECKPOINT and RE-ENTRY carries a Step Token.
 *
 * Deciding the second one the other way costs more than it saves. Closing the
 * scan once any marker has been seen would also drop a completion that a
 * marker-shaped LOG line precedes — a shape Codex does produce, and one the
 * wrapper tests pin.
