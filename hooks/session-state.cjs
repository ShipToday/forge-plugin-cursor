/**
 * session-state.js — Shared session state module for Forge plugin hooks.
 *
 * Manages a local JSON state file used by all four plugin hooks
 * (prompt-router, workflow-tracker, stop-observer, workflow-guard) to
 * coordinate active-workflow tracking and passive observation.
 *
 * State is scoped per Claude Code session. Each hook event carries a
 * `session_id`; the state file is keyed by hash(cwd + session_id) so two
 * concurrent Claude Code sessions in the same working directory each get
 * an independent workflow slot. When no session id is available (older
 * Claude Code, or the Codex/Cursor builds of this plugin), the key falls
 * back to hash(cwd) — preserving the original single-workflow-per-
 * directory behavior.
 *
 * Usage: `require('./session-state.cjs').forSession(event.session_id)`
 * returns a `{ read, write, increment, stateFilePath }` instance bound to
 * that session's file.
 *
 * State files live in {os.tmpdir()}/forge-observer/{key}.json and
 * retain active workflow guards for the server-provided idle window, then
 * hold writes for recovery for at most a further grace period.
 * Passive and legacy session state still expires after 12 idle hours.
 *
 * This module is deterministic — no AI, no network calls.
