# Forge Autopilot

You are routing product development requests to Forge via the `forge` MCP
server. The user does NOT need to say "forge" or "@forge" — detect their intent
from the skill description above and call the right tool automatically.

Forge's workflow catalog lives on the server side and is fully data-driven.
You don't need to know which workflows exist — `forge__start_workflow` will
return a classifier prompt listing all available workflows (Forge defaults
plus any org-specific workflows configured for the current user) when it
needs the client AI to choose. Just call it and follow the instructions.

## Step 1: Detect connected tools

Before calling any Forge tool, build the `connected_tools` array by checking
which MCP tools are available in the current session:

| Connector     | Look for these tool names                                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| jira          | searchJiraIssuesUsingJql, createJiraIssue, updateJiraIssue    |
| linear        | list_issues, get_issue, create_issue, save_issue              |
| github        | `gh` CLI available via shell, or GitHub connector tools         |
| slack         | slack_send_message, slack_search_users, slack_search_channels |
| confluence    | searchConfluenceUsingCql, getConfluencePage                   |
| notion        | notion-search, notion-fetch, notion-create-pages              |
| granola       | search_meetings, get_meeting_transcript                       |
| figma         | get_design_context, get_screenshot, get_metadata              |
| local_code    | filesystem/shell access (always include in coding environments) |

Only include connectors you can verify. Always include `local_code` when you
have filesystem access.

## Step 1b: Detect local skills

Build the `local_skills` array by checking your available skills, rules, or
slash commands. Include every skill **relevant to product development or the
software development lifecycle** — anything a Forge workflow step could draw
on, such as brainstorming, planning, requirements, estimation, architecture
analysis, code review, debugging, testing, or documentation. Relevance — not
whether the skill is project-specific — is the test: a general-purpose skill
still counts if it supports SDLC work.

A Forge workflow step can declare one of these as a *required* local skill,
so under-declaring a relevant skill will block the step that depends on it.
When in doubt, include it — over-declaring a relevant skill is harmless.

Do NOT include skills unrelated to product/SDLC work (e.g. presentation,
document, or spreadsheet builders, image or media generators) or built-in
platform commands (`/help`, `/clear`, etc.) — Forge workflows never use these.

| Source      | Where to look                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cursor      | Skills from installed plugins and rules loaded from `.cursor/rules/` shown in your system context |
| Codex       | Skills listed in the current session or loaded from the project |

For each skill found, include `{ "name": "<skill-name>", "description": "<brief description>" }`.
If no relevant local skills are found, omit the `local_skills` parameter entirely.

## Step 2: Route the request

### Continuation boundary — check before calling Forge

Use the full conversation, not only the user's latest sentence, to decide
whether this is a new SDLC outcome or continuation of concrete work that is
already scoped. Handle the request normally without starting Forge when the
user is:

- implementing specific changes already requested or reviewed in this session;
- resolving a merge conflict or applying known review comments;
- editing known files, adding already-specified tests, or fixing an already-
  diagnosed local defect; or
- committing, pushing, creating, or updating a pull request for work already
  in progress.

This boundary still allows Forge when the current request explicitly invokes
Forge, directly names a tracked work item as the requested outcome's target, asks
to run a catalog workflow (for example,
"review this PR"), or asks for a new product/process outcome that has not
already been scoped. The distinction is the requested outcome: **review a PR**
is workflow-shaped; **apply these review changes and update the PR** is coding
continuation. A work item key that appears only in earlier turns or as historical
context does not override this boundary.

For any product/SDLC request that passes this boundary, your **default action** is:

→ `forge__start_workflow(feature_request, connected_tools, local_skills: <detected_skills>)`

Do NOT pass an explicit `workflow` parameter on the initial call and do NOT
try to route to a server-side skill. When intent selection is needed, Forge
returns the enabled workflow catalog for this user and organization.

- If one workflow clearly matches, re-call `forge__start_workflow` with that
  explicit catalog workflow id and `classification_complete: true`.
- If multiple catalog workflows are plausible, present only the relevant
  catalog workflows to the user. After they choose, re-call with that explicit
  workflow id and `classification_complete: true`.
- Never invent a workflow, expose a server-side skill id as an option, or set
  `classification_complete: true` without an explicit `workflow`.

The server-provided workflow catalog is the source of truth; the client AI
owns the contextual choice among those available workflows.

### Admission proposal — validate before activation

A post-classification call returns a server-resolved **workflow proposal**
before it creates an active conversation. Compare its entry step, missing
inputs, configured path, and potential side effects with the user's **full
conversation and current phase**:

- If they align, re-call `forge__start_workflow` with the same arguments plus
  the returned `admission_token` and `start_confirmed: true`.
- If they do not align, do **not** confirm and do **not** call
  `forge__abandon_workflow` — no workflow has started. Choose another workflow
  only when it is an exact catalog match. If none matches, continue normally
  when this is coding continuation, otherwise explain that no available Forge
  workflow fits.
- Never set `start_confirmed: true` without the server-issued
  `admission_token` from the immediately preceding proposal.

### Exception 1 — Help / recommendation request

"What should I do with PROJ-123?", "help with PROJ-123", "where to start"

→ `forge__start_workflow(feature_request, connected_tools, recommendation: true, local_skills: <detected_skills>)`

### Exception 2 — Session observer (passive tracking)

Triggered by the `stop-observer.cjs` stop hook — the auto-submitted
follow-up turn's input contains "observe session" or "observe_session
workflow".

→ `forge__start_workflow(feature_request: "Passive session observation", connected_tools, workflow: "observe_session", local_skills: <detected_skills>)`

The `observe_session` workflow is a single-step workflow that wraps the
session observer. It is marked `auto_classify: false` server-side so it
is invisible to the intent classifier — the only valid entry point is
this explicit `workflow: "observe_session"` argument.

Follow the returned instructions to present a tracking nudge to the user.
Do NOT classify this as a build/bug/architecture request — it's a passive check.

#### After any workflow completes — read `follow_up`

When a workflow returns `Workflow complete.`, look at the final
`state_updates` payload you sent. If it includes a non-null `follow_up`
object, **you MUST chain to that workflow before resuming the user's
original request**. Status reports and session-observer outcomes both use
this structured handoff contract.

```
forge__start_workflow(
  feature_request: <follow_up.feature_request>,
  connected_tools: <same array as before>,
  epic_key: <follow_up.epic_key>,
  workflow: <follow_up.workflow>,
  classification_complete: <follow_up.classification_complete ?? true>,
  pre_forge_context: <follow_up.pre_forge_context>,
  local_skills: <detected_skills>
)
```

The four-field structured shape keeps the bound work item key
clean: `epic_key` is passed as a structured parameter so any
`PROJ-NNN`-shaped strings inside `pre_forge_context` cannot hijack the
binding via the embedded-key regex.

If `follow_up` is `null` or absent, do **not** chain. Continue the
conversation normally.

**Common failure mode to avoid**: treating "Workflow complete" as
"the workflow is done — go back to the user's original ask". A selected
follow-up is an explicit user route; silently ignoring it leaves that choice
unhonored. Always read `follow_up` before resuming.

### Exception 3 — Session checkpoint (passive time tracking)

Triggered by the `stop-observer.cjs` stop hook for an already-tracked
(`logged` / `linked`) session — input contains "session checkpoint" and
spells out a complete `forge__update_state` call (`conversation_id`,
`completed_step`, `state_updates`).

→ Call `forge__update_state` exactly as the directive specifies — pass
the `conversation_id` and `state_updates` verbatim. The `conversation_id`
is the original `observe_session` conversation; the server records the
elapsed time as a silent audit event.

Do NOT start a workflow, do NOT classify this as a build/bug/architecture
request, and do NOT surface anything to the user — it is a passive,
silent check. After the call, continue normally.

## Step 3: Follow the workflow

Pass the user's request as `feature_request` (strip pleasantries, keep substance).

After calling `start_workflow`, Forge returns step-by-step instructions.
Follow them:

1. Execute each step as instructed
2. When a step says to ask the user a question, ask the user directly. If a
   structured user-input tool is available, use it as the only tool call in
   that response, then wait for the answer before continuing.
3. If the answer is empty (Skip button), record "TBD" and move on
4. After completing each step, call `forge__update_state` with the results
   AND the `step_token` from the most recent response (see below)
5. If Forge returns `needsDisambiguation` or `needsIntentClassification`,
   present options or pick a workflow per the returned instructions and re-call

### Workflow guard — what is enforced

Forge installs a `preToolUse` hook (`workflow-guard.cjs`) that **denies**
tool calls when the active step does not allow them. Two layers:

**Layer 1 — CHECKPOINT enforcement.** When the orchestrator returns a
`**CHECKPOINT**` response from `forge__update_state` (a relayed-question
skill is awaiting user input), the only tools you may call until the
user has answered are:

- user-input tool or direct user question — relay the pending question
- `forge__update_state` — advance with the user's answer
- `forge__abandon_workflow` — exit cleanly (see below)
- Read-only inspection: filesystem reads, search, web fetch/search when
  available, plus read-only MCP tools (names starting with `list_`, `get_`,
  `search_`, `query_`, `fetch_`, `notion-search`, `notion-fetch`)

**Layer 2 — Per-step `tool_permissions`.** Every step transition publishes
a `**Tool Permissions**: cat1, cat2, …` line listing the categories the
active step is allowed to use. The hook denies any tool whose category
is not in the list. Categories are coarse:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| `read_code` | filesystem reads and search (always allowed regardless) |
| `ask_user` | direct user question or structured user-input tool |
| `web` | web fetch and web search tools |
| `tracker_read` | `list_issues`, `get_issue`, `list_comments`, `search_threads`, … |
| `tracker_write` | `save_issue`, `create_issue`, `save_comment`, `update_issue`, … |
| `docs_read` / `docs_write` | Notion read / write |
| `messaging` | Slack send |
| `calendar` / `design` / `meetings` | Per-connector groups |
| `code_edit` | code-editing tools such as `Write`, `Edit`, or `apply_patch` |
| `shell` | shell execution tools (`Shell`) |

Concretely: `readiness_check` does not allow `code_edit` or `shell`, so
editing during it is denied. `begin_code_execution` allows both,
so editing during it is allowed. `notify_tech_lead` allows `messaging`
but not `tracker_write` — the model can send a Slack message but not
silently rewrite the ticket.

Anything denied gets an actionable reason that points at the three
legitimate next moves: relay the user question, advance
(`forge__update_state`), or abandon (`forge__abandon_workflow`).
This makes silent-bypass structurally impossible, not just discouraged.

If you receive a deny decision for a tool you genuinely need, the right
move is usually to advance the workflow — the next step's allowlist
likely includes the tool you want.

### Step token — pass it back on every `update_state`

Every `start_workflow` and `update_state` response also includes a line:

```
**Step Token**: `step_<uuid>` — include this in your next `forge__update_state` call
```

When you call `forge__update_state`, include the most recent token via
`state_updates.step_token: "<token>"`. The orchestrator validates it
matches the conversation's current step — a mismatch means the
conversation has already advanced (typically a sub-agent advanced it
without your knowledge), and the call is rejected with an actionable
error pointing you at `forge__get_workflow_state` for recovery.

For relayed-question CHECKPOINT and RE-ENTRY responses the token does
NOT rotate — re-use the same token until the workflow actually
advances to a new step. The token rotates on every real step advance.

### Sub-agent relay — verify the envelope, fetch canonical state when absent

If you delegate a step to a sub-agent, pass the current step's token
into the sub-agent prompt verbatim — the sub-agent threads it through
its own `update_state` call. The orchestrator's response to that call
(carrying the *new* `step_token` and the next step's instructions) is
delivered to whoever made the MCP call: the sub-agent. The sub-agent
MUST return that response to you (the parent) **VERBATIM**.

To detect a missing envelope mechanically rather than heuristically, the
orchestrator wraps the next-step instructions in a `<<<FORGE_NEXT_STEP
token="…" bytes=N>>>` … `<<<END FORGE_NEXT_STEP>>>` envelope. The
parser accepts the envelope on **sentinels + token**; `bytes=N` is an
optional integrity annotation. After every sub-agent return:

1. Scan the return for the envelope. If either sentinel is missing —
   or the opening sentinel is restructured so `token="…"` no longer
   sits on it — the sub-agent didn't include a parseable envelope.
2. If both sentinels are present AND the opening sentinel declares
   `bytes=N`, compute the UTF-8 byte length of the body between them
   and compare against `N`. Mismatch = the sub-agent paraphrased
   inside otherwise-correct sentinels.
3. If both sentinels are present but `bytes=N` is **absent** (a
   common smaller-model paraphrase mode — the agent keeps the
   sentinel shape but drops the byte count as "boring metadata"),
   trust the envelope on sentinel + token alone. No fetch needed —
   the next-step body is good as-is.
4. On a step-1 fail (missing/restructured sentinels) OR step-2
   mismatch (declared bytes don't match), call
   `forge__get_workflow_state(conversation_id: "<id>")` to fetch the
   canonical step body and current step_token. This is the designed
   recovery channel — read-only, idempotent, and owner-checked.
   Findings the sub-agent put in `display_text` are preserved as a
   `## Findings` block in the fetched response, so no analytical
   output is dropped — only the verbatim relay shortcut was skipped.

**Diagnostic phrasing**: when this happens, describe it as a fetch
("the envelope isn't in the sub-agent's return — fetching canonical
state") rather than as a failure ("the relay was lost"). The findings
layer is the system's designed answer to envelope-not-present, so the
information path stayed intact even though the shortcut path didn't.
This wording matters for the user reading your message — "lost" reads
as a regression, "fetching" reads as a normal recovery.

A summarized or paraphrased return without the envelope leaves the
parent with a stale token if it doesn't fall through to the state
fetch — the new token lives ONLY in the orchestrator's response body,
and your parent CANNOT see the sub-agent's tool results. The `STEP
BOUNDARY` directive injected into delegated prompts repeats this
requirement and names the envelope explicitly. This applies uniformly
across Claude Code (Agent tool), Codex (`spawn_agent`), Cursor, and
any other environment with sub-agent delegation.

### Escape hatch — `forge__abandon_workflow`

If the workflow no longer applies — the user redirected to unrelated work,
the classifier picked the wrong workflow, or scope changed mid-stream — call
`forge__abandon_workflow(conversation_id, reason)` to cleanly close the
conversation. This is the **only** correct way to exit a workflow without
completing it.

- **Do NOT silently bypass** the workflow by skipping `forge__update_state`
  calls and proceeding directly with implementation. Silent bypass leaves
  the audit trail blind to *why* the workflow stopped applying — the team
  loses signal about which workflows misroute and why.
- The `reason` is required, must be at least 8 characters, and is recorded
  in the audit trail. Make it meaningful (e.g., "user redirected to fix-bug
  workflow", "scope changed — going direct on a 1-line change", "wrong
  workflow classified, restarting"). Don't write filler like "abandoning"
  or "no longer needed".
- Idempotent: re-abandoning returns the original record. Safe to retry.
- After abandoning, you may start a fresh workflow with `forge__start_workflow`
  or proceed without one. Subsequent `forge__update_state` calls against
  the abandoned conversation will be rejected.

## Step 4: Respect model delegation rules

Forge responses include a `**Model Routing**` metadata line with the recommended
model tier. You MUST check this line and delegate when your current model does
not match the recommended tier.

### How to read the routing signal

The response metadata contains a line like:

```
**Model Routing**: tier=balanced | model=gpt-5.6-terra | environment=codex | guidance=codex_model_map | complexity=medium | task=planning
```

The `tier` value tells you which capability tier to use. The optional `model`
value is only exact when the `guidance` variant names a maintained model map
for your current environment. If no `model` is present, use the tier language
only: pick your fastest, balanced, or most capable available model.

### How to delegate

Follow the instructions in the Model Routing block returned by Forge:

| Routing signal | What to do |
|----------------|------------|
| `guidance=claude_code_model_map` | Use the concrete model parameter Forge provides. |
| `guidance=codex_model_map` | Use the provided Codex model hint when your Agent or model switch supports it; otherwise choose the same tier in Codex. |
| `guidance=model_agnostic_tier` | Do not invent a model name. Choose your tool's available model that matches the tier. |

A delegated sub-agent inherits your MCP tools and can call external
connectors directly.

**CRITICAL**: Sub-agents execute ONE step only. The `---DELEGATE BELOW---`
content already includes a step boundary directive. After the sub-agent returns,
YOU (the parent) **MUST display the sub-agent's full analysis, findings, and
substantive output to the user immediately — before launching the next
sub-agent, calling `forge__update_state`, or asking any confirmation
question.** This rule fires on every sub-agent return, not just before
confirmations. Do NOT summarize or paraphrase — reproduce the sub-agent's key
content (analysis results, discovery summaries, recommendations, structured
findings) so the user can see exactly what was produced. Then continue the
workflow by interpreting the next step yourself. Do NOT expect the sub-agent
to chain multiple steps.

Common loophole to avoid: when a sub-agent's return bundles both its
substantive findings AND state-advancement metadata (e.g. "advanced to step
3, here's the next-step instructions"), it is tempting to read the whole
return as workflow plumbing and skip straight to the next sub-agent. Don't.
The findings are user-facing; the state metadata is internal. Surface the
findings first, every time.

### Self-check: which tier are you?

- **fast** - lightweight/low-cost model tier
- **balanced** - default reasoning model tier
- **capable** - strongest available reasoning model tier

If you already match the recommended tier, execute the instructions directly —
no delegation needed. If you do NOT match, delegate or switch using the
environment-specific guidance Forge returned — unless the step's **Worth-it
check** flags the remaining work as a pre-computed replay (content already in
workflow state, no new generation), in which case run it inline regardless of
tier.

### Rules

1. **Always check** — if `**Model Routing**` is present, evaluate it before
   executing the step instructions
2. **Delegate both up and down** — if the tier says "capable", use your
   strongest available model; if it says "fast", use your lightweight model
3. **Announce delegation** — briefly tell the user before delegating
   (e.g., "Delegating to a balanced model for this step...")
4. **Pass the full prompt** — everything below `---DELEGATE BELOW---` in the
   instructions is the delegated prompt. Include all of it
5. **Delegate when it pays for itself, not reflexively** — for real work
   that's off your tier, delegating up buys better reasoning and down saves
   real cost. But each step's advisory carries a **Worth-it check**: when the
   remaining work is only replaying content already in workflow state (a
   pre-computed `pending_*` post, no new generation), run it inline on your
   current model — spawning a sub-agent for that just burns a round-trip.
   Follow the per-step Worth-it check; don't skip delegation merely because
   direct execution is easier

## Step 5: Coexist with planning / read-only modes

Some environments enter a **planning or read-only mode** for non-trivial
work (for example, Cursor's Ask mode answers without editing, and some
setups gate writes behind plan approval). In such a mode, non-readonly tool
calls are restricted and you are expected to present a plan for the user to
approve before any writes happen.

When a read-only / planning mode is active AND a Forge workflow is requested,
**both protocols apply** — they are not in conflict:

1. **Routing still applies** — call `forge__start_workflow` to fetch the
   right workflow. This is a read-only call to Forge; it has no side
   effects on the user's systems.
2. **Execute only the read-only operations** from the workflow's
   instructions — typically the early "fetch context" steps that read
   from the project tracker, codebase, or documentation tools.
3. **Defer writes** — surface every write the workflow would normally
   perform (status updates via `save_issue`, ticket comments, code edits,
   `forge__update_state` calls) as part of the plan you present to the user.
   Do NOT execute those writes while the read-only mode is active.
4. **After the mode exits** (the user approves the plan), resume the
   workflow from where you paused — call `forge__update_state` to
   advance through the deferred steps in order until the workflow
   completes.

**Why both protocols are compatible**: a read-only mode constrains *which
tools you may call*, not *which workflows you may consider*. Forge's routing
(which workflow to use, what its steps look like) is informational at this
stage. Writes are deferred, not skipped — the workflow completes normally
once the mode releases you to act.

**Anti-pattern to avoid**: do NOT abandon the Forge workflow mid-step
because a read-only mode is active. If you've called `forge__start_workflow`
and read the step instructions, complete the read-only portions and present
the deferred writes in your plan — do not pivot to a parallel
investigation that ignores the workflow. Abandoning leaves the session's
`active_workflow` flag stuck (workflow-tracker.cjs only clears it on
completion), which causes every subsequent prompt to be treated as a
continuation of a stale workflow.

## What NOT to route

Regular coding tasks should be handled normally without Forge:

- "Write a function that..." — pure code
- "Refactor this component" — pure code (unless tied to a ticket)
- "Add a test for..." — pure code
- "Read this file" / "explain this code" — exploration
- "Commit my changes" / "push to main" — git operations
- "What does this error mean?" — debugging Q&A

The line: if the user is talking about the **product development process**
(planning, scoping, tracking, handing off, reviewing against requirements,
auditing, releasing), route to Forge. If they're just writing code directly,
don't.
